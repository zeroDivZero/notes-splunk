# DEPLOYMENT

## Single-Instance

Single Splunk instance handles all functions such as input, parsing, indexing, and searching.

Meant for proof of concept, personal use, learning, small department-size environment.

## Multi-Instances

To scale in production, need multiple specialized Splunk instances. This allows multiple search heads and indexers to increase searching and indexing capacities. Search heads and indexers can be clustered to make sure data is always available and searchable.
